DESCRIPTION: Room: Main Hall Join using link:  https://eventyay.com/e/6b90
 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  There are many open source tools to help you w
 ith the different steps you typically need to extract insights from your d
 ata. As you scale and grow your use of data\, keeping on top of the steps 
 can be difficult. Apache Airflow is an open source orchestration tool that
  helps you to programmatically create workflows in Python that will help y
 ou run\, schedule\, monitor and mange data engineering pipelines - no more
  manually managing those cron jobs! In this session\, we will take a look 
 at the architecture of Apache Airflow\, and walk you through creating your
  first workflow and how you can use a growing number of provider libraries
  to help you work with other open source tools and services. This session 
 is intended for beginners/those wanting to learn more about this open sour
 ce project.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  Many have been flooded with news about “Supp
 ly Chain Security”. Why are end users\, enterprises\, and governments cl
 amoring for it and why do I\, as an open source contributor\, need to care
  about it? Is this something that can be implemented easily? Enter sigstor
 e\, a project coming out of the OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation).
  The main goal of sigstore is to make signing artifacts\, validating depen
 dencies\, and monitoring dependency releases\, as easy as possible for dev
 elopers. If we can lower the barrier of entry for open source projects to 
 release software securely\, we can make the world a better place.

DESCRIPTION: Room: Main Hall Join using link:  https://eventyay.com/e/6b90
 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  As the Internet has become more and more cruci
 al to daily life and the economy\, coupled with growing concerns about com
 petition online\, there has been increasing discussion about mandating int
 eroperability among software services and systems. The technical interface
  required to achieve such an outcome is often implicit\, and one of the ma
 in aims of this paper is to make it explicit and bring its implications in
 to the open.  This mandating of open interfaces is important\, because 
 – done well – it brings economic\, social\, and technical benefits\, r
 educes the risk of market failure and stimulates sustainable innovation. B
 ut done poorly\, it can threaten these outcomes and jeopardize other polic
 y goals\, such as privacy\, security\, and the resilience of systems.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  Operating system in 21th century\, especially 
 GNU/Linux\, plays a solid foundation for various computing devices\, rangi
 ng from datacenter to embedded systems. CPU scheduling\, one of the core s
 ervices provided by an operating system\, is extremely complicated in Linu
 x such that it can provide decent throughput/latency for the aforementione
 d usages. In this talk\, we introduce the evolution of the CPU scheduler i
 n Linux\, starting from the very beginning scheduler (a scheduler which pi
 cks task from a runqueue composed of an array) to the CFS (Completely Fair
  Scheduler). Besides\, key features in the CFS are also covered in the tal
 k\, e.g.\, PELT (Per-Entity Load Tracking).

 pace until the I/O request has been completed. Besides blocking\, each sys
 call will undergo two-time mode switches\, whose overhead cannot be ignore
 d after Meltdown and Spectre mitigation. Some syscall–heavy applications
  have been reported to be slowed down to 30% on KPTI-protected systems. Bo
 th blocking and mode switch seriously hamper the performance\, especially 
 for I/O-intensive applications (e.g. HTTP daemons and database servers). T
 o suppress blocking time of userland procedure and overhead from mode swit
 ch\, it is common to adopt asynchronous I/O model. In Linux 2.5\, Linux na
 tive AIO (libaio) was introduced\, which is a kernel-level implementation 
 and performs better than POSIX AIO. However\, it only supports direct I/O\
 , limits the file size\, and other more and more restrictions. They lead l
 ibaio hard to use and inefficient. In Linux 5.1\, Jens Axboe proposed an a
 synchronous I/O interface: io_uring which makes Linux native AIO more effi
 cient and extends its applicability. In this talk\, we will introduce the 
 evolution of Linux I/O models. Further\, we will detailly explain the desi
 gn\, implementation\, and optimization of io_uring.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  As the most popular open source relational dat
 abase in the world\, PostgreSQL keeps attracting the significant attention
  it deserves. With the ever increasing data storage and query requirements
 \, new challenges are brought forward for horizontal elastic expansion and
  security of the PostgreSQL database. How to provide existing PostgreSQL d
 atabases with incremental capabilities such as data sharding\, data encryp
 tion and other functions is of great concern to many PostgreSQL users.This
  session will focus on introducing how to empower PostgreSQL thanks to the
  ecosystem provided by Apache ShardingSphere - an open source distributed 
 database\, plus an ecosystem users and developers need for their database 
 to provide a customized and cloud-native experience. ShardingSphere doesn'
 t quite fit into the usual industry mold of a simple distributed database 
 middleware solution. ShardingSphere recreates the distributed pluggable sy
 stem\, enabling actual user implementation scenarios to thrive and contrib
 uting valuable solutions to the community and the database industry.The ai
 m of ShardingSphere is the Database Plus concept.Database Plus sets out to
  build a standard layer and an ecosystem layer above the fragmented databa
 se's basic services. A unified and standardized database usage specificati
 on provides for upper-level applications\, and the challenges faced by bus
 inesses due to underlying databases fragmentation get minimized as much as
  possible. To link databases and applications\, it uses traffic and data r
 endering and parsing. It provides users with enhanced core features\, such
  as a distributed database\, data security\, database gateway\, and stress
  testing.ShardingSphere uses a pluggable kernel architecture for Database 
 Plus. That means there's modularity\, which provides flexibility for the u
 ser.  Demos and notable use cases in production environments that are from
  the Asia equivalents of FAANG (Facebook\, Amazon etc.) will be used to in
 troduce the use and implementation of these functions for PostgreSQL datab
 ases.

 kthanks and Internews to develop a series of resources that help Open Sour
 ce tool teams understand how design processes and practices can benefit OS
 S and where to begin in small\, simple ways within OSS contributor communi
 ties. Understanding what user testing can offer OSS and why it differs fro
 m the typical ‘developer contributor feedback’ to ‘PR submission imp
 rovements’ can help you to centre people that you might not even know ar
 e using your OSS tool. User testing helps you broaden the usefulness of yo
 ur OSS for the users you already know well\, and also gets you to consider
  users you might not know well.  In this participatory workshop you’ll l
 earn about what user testing can be\, how it can be done within a small OS
 S tool team\, and start to practice the skills and processes for user test
 ing so you can take these back to your OSS communities as well as synthesi
 s of user research data as an OSS team to inform priorities in your OSS ba

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  In the Pocket Science Lab Project we create ph
 one and desktop applications to collect measurements and data to solve glo
 bal problems with science and build a sustainable world. With the PSLab mo
 bile and desktop apps it is possible to use sensors of a phone or desktop 
 PC to collect measurements and data. The app comes with a built-in Oscillo
 scope\, Multimeter\, Wave Generator\, Logic Analyzer\, Power Source\, and 
 we are constantly adding more digital instruments or even robotic controls
 . With PSLab applications your phone or PC becomes like many devices in on
 e. Adding widely available Open Standards sensors and the PSLab board you 
 are able extend your device to be a complete lab in the pocket. You can co
 llect air data\, temperature\, water quality\, the level of radioactivity 
 and anything you could imagine. Once you are ready you can share the data\
 , draw scientific conclusions\, and start to take action to change the wor
 ld around you to be more sustainable. And as a developer you are able to c
 reate your own plugins and front-ends to integrate the PSLab science libra
 ries into other solutions.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  Since the beginning of the PSLab project\, we 
 have been rethinking its stack\, architecture and components multiple time
 s. The desktop app has shifted from Python and Qt to Electron\, the Python
  library has been rewritten\, and the firmware is being reworked these day
 s. During this process\, complexity has grown and shrunk: While the Python
  library is now easier to use and work on\, the desktop applications needs
  a bridge to talk to it\, going through various channels and requiring a l
 ot of knowledge to set up. At the same time\, new opportunities and techno
 logies are developing\, of which this talk discusses two possible integrat
 ions we are planning to make the PSLab desktop app more portable and easie
 r to use again: Based on previous work of an initial driver for PSLab in t
 he Sigrok project\, we can simplify the strong coupling with the Python li
 brary and use a native\, direct interface instead\, and thanks to WebAssem
 bly\, we can even put the existing user interface as it is on the web\, so
  that it works without explicit installation.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  ScaleDown is an open-source framework and comm
 unity that provides free training and mentorship as well as fosters collab
 oration and innovation in TinyML.What is TinyML?TinyML devices like Arduin
 os are resource-constrained. This means that they are usually small\, batt
 ery-powered\, and have low computation power and memory. Deploying neural 
 networks on such devices is difficult due to how large they are in terms o
 f their memory footprint and the number of operations needed to execute th
 em. So we need to optimize and scale down neural networks to deploy them. 
 This machine learning paradigm is known as TinyML. It is estimated that th
 ere will be more than 60 billion IoT devices worldwide by 2035. Many of th
 em will be equipped with TinyML capabilities.Why is Learning TinyML Hard?H
 owever\, there is a wide gap in the community for learning resources and t
 ools to help beginners and early career professionals learn about TinyML\,
  experiment\, and make products to build a portfolio to get jobs. To help 
 people better understand this field\, we do community work like hosting wo
 rkshops\, study groups\, and talks. We also create free learning resources
  like books and courses.There are many TinyML optimization algorithms\, bu
 t the tools landscape is fragmented with each framework supporting differe
 nt algorithms and only on specific model types. Moreover\, they only suppo
 rt a few algorithms and not the latest\, better-performing algorithms. Thi
 s makes these tools less accessible to disadvantaged groups who may not ha
 ve access to those software or hardware. Moreover\, they are not easy for 
 beginners to learn. Scaledown is bridging that gap by building a framework
  that can take models trained in any framework\, optimize them using the l
 atest algorithms\, and then deploy them to TinyML devices. Finally\, we he
 lp grow the field by doing research and giving opportunities for collabora
 tion within the community. Link: https://scaledown-team.github.io/What wil
 l the workshop cover?In this talk\, we will cover the two pillars of educa
 tion and the framework at ScaleDown. Along with these pillars\, we have al
 so started a “Hardware Library” in Singapore\, from where people can b
 orrow hardware that they want to work with and then return them for differ
 ent hardware when they are done. This will help people build a portfolio o
 f projects with multiple hardware and tools that they can then leverage to
  get career or internship opportunities. Our blogs\, books\, and study gro
 ups will help you learn TinyML. The hardware library will help you build y
 our first project using the framework. After implementing your projects\, 
 you can write about your experience and help grow the community by teachin
 g others. In this way\, Education will feed into the Framework.The audienc
 e will learn how to implement the ScaleDown framework in a few lines of co
 de and also check out our easy-to-do projects! Join us through this worksh
 op to see ScaleDown in action and learn how you can be a part of our open-

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  Developing cross-platform applications is comp
 lex. Some frameworks allow us to share the business logic\, some go furthe
 r and allow us to share the UI layer\, often limited to the lowest common 
 denominator among target platforms. But even then – working with device 
 hardware still requires not only error-prone platform-specific code but al
 so developers familiar with each of the target platforms to maintain it. W
 hat if there was a framework\, which would allow you write all your code i
 n C# and XAML\, with unlimited styling and templating capabilities\, and a
  single API to access device hardware and APIs? And what if you could use 
 this framework to target all mobile and desktop devices and even the web? 
 Meet the Uno Platform - your C#/XAML apps on Windows\, Android\, iOS\, mac
 OS\, Linux\, and WebAssembly!

 in moving towards collective responsibility for incident prevention with t
 he rise of no-blame post mortems\, we often lag behind many industries in 
 understanding human error and what we can optimize for in order to maximiz
 e the human contribution to incident prevention and recovery.  Crew Resou
 rce Management comes out of aviation and refers to the use of all availabl
 e resources in order to ensure safe and efficient operations\, and focuses
  very heavily on this topic.At both Adjust GmbH and DeliveryHero we have h

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  For deploying any application/workload remotel
 y\, you’re entrusting someone else to take the workload’s component el
 ements : code and data and run them on their computer. The problem is that
  the firm or individuals who execute your task on their computer have the 
 ability to peek into it\, change it\, and even stop it from running if the
 y so desire.The purpose of TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) is to use
  technology to solve this issue. It is a secure area within the host where
  sensitive workloads can be run. TEE can be defined as a hardware-based me
 chanism for securing critical data and algorithms in such a way that not e
 ven the kernel\, root user\, or hypervisor can see what’s going on. TEEs
  are great because you can start running your workloads in such a way that
  they are protected.TEEs are awesome but they have a few limitations. This
  is where Enarx comes into picture. Enarx works on a few core principles t
 o get rid of the limitations posed by the TEEs and make the system even mo
 re secure and readily compatible.

  people developing public-purpose software understand how the Standard for
  Public Code can help them collaborate. The Standard is of course applicab
 le to everyone developing open source software\, and is especially useful 
 if you want other organizations to be able to contribute to your code.We h
 ope to inspire collaboration across public organizations and show that it 
 is not that hard to create genuinely reusable code.By applying the Standar
 d\, code will not only be reusable and open source on paper\, but also in 
 practice. The talk will also answer the following questions:* What is publ
 ic code?* Why the need for a Standard for Public Code?* How can I prepare 
 to ensure there are no blockers for collaboration.erivćThe talk will show
  how the Foundation for Public Code is already applying the Standard to so
 me codebases\, and how this has helped those communities.

 y advancements in the past 20 years\, the distributed systems community ha
 s not enjoyed an equivalent developer experience: There is no abstraction 
 that mitigates failure on a platform level\, guaranteeing correctness on a
 n application level. As a developer\, we have to think about it a lot. Te
 mporal is an open source platform that mitigates failure on a platform le
 vel: Temporal core abstraction\, its unit of execution\, reliability\, an
 d scalability\, is the Temporal Workflow. You may think of a Temporal Wor
 kflow Definition as a regular Function Definition—in fact\, that is the 
 developer experience that Temporal provides to its users—but a Workflow 
 Execution provides stunning improvements over a regular Function Execution
 . In particular\, a Temporal Workflow Execution provides effectively once 
 execution guarantees and cannot fail!Using a systems modeling approach\, t
 his presentation explores how Temporal mitigates failure on a platform le
 vel and dives deep into the mechanics of a platform that provides a develo
 per experience of distributed systems that rivals the developer experience
  of databases.

 1f56/video/Main%20Hall/630  With the rapid onset of the global Covid-19 Pa
 ndemic in 2020 the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) qu
 ickly implemented a new Covid-19 pipeline to collect testing data from all
  of the USA’s states and territories\, and produce multiple consumable r
 esults for federal and public agencies. They did this in under 30 days\, u
 sing Apache Kafka.Inspired by this story\, we built two demonstration stre
 aming pipelines for ingesting\, storing\, and visualizing public IoT data 
 (Tidal data from NOAA\, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratio
 n) using multiple open source technologies. The common ingestion technolog
 ies were Apache Kafka\, Apache Kafka Connect\, and Apache Camel Kafka Conn
 ector\, supplemented with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. The initi
 al experiment used Open Distro for Elasticsearch and Kibana as the target 
 storage and visualisation technologies\, while the second experiment used 
 PostgreSQL and Apache Superset.In this talk we introduce each technology a
 nd the pipeline architecture\, and walk through the steps followed\, chall
 enges encountered\, and solutions used to build reliable and scalable pipe
 lines\, and visualize the results. We compare and contrast the two approac
 hes\, focussing on exception handling\, scalability\, performance and moni
